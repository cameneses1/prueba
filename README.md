# PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE 

Baseline study on the development of predictive maintenance techniques using open data. Classic predictive maintennance problems will be studied:
- Classification of the signal as healthy or faulty.
- Failure type classification.
- Prediction of time to failure.

## Data used
Different data obtained from open repositories will be used:
- Failure classification (healthy, inner race or outer race). In this case two different signal types are used:
    - Signals captured under constant speed conditions: for this purpose, we have used data from [CWRU](https://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/welcome-case-western-reserve-university-bearing-data-center-website)
    - Signals captured under variable speed conditions: in this case, we hace use data from [Bearing Vibration Data under Time-varying Rotational Speed Conditions](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/v43hmbwxpm/1)
- Prediction of time to failure. In this case we have used the data set called _Bearing Data Set_ which is provided by the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), University of Cincinnati, and is available in the [NASA Data Repository](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/).
